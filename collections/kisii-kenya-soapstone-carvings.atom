    <td colspan="2"><p>Hand carved from soapstone by African craftsmen, this menorah is an elegant way to illuminate each night of Hanukkah.  Each piece is mined from the Kisii hills of Kenya, and then chiseled and carved into shape. Because the artisans use rudimentary carving tools following traditional methods passed down through the ages, each piece will have differences in size, exact shape and texture.  Candle holes may possibly not be symmetrical. These nuances attest to the unique, one-of-a-kind beauty of each piece. <br> <br><strong>Product features:</strong></p><ul>
<li>Measures 12 x 2.5 x 6 inches. Due to the hand-carved nature, exact size may vary.</li>
<li>Weighs approximately 15 lbs.</li>
<li>Natural color stone. Colors may range from cream to grey to earthy gold in any single piece.</li>
<li>Soapstone is a soft stone, making it ideal for carving into many forms. Use care when handling to avoid breakage. </li>
