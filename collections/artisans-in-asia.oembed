Excess fabric is trimmed off, and the bead is complete. They are then strung together until they are transformed into one-of-a-kind necklaces, earrings or bracelets. The beads are assorted so the final piece of jewelry has a unique array of colors and patterns.\u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"WorldFinds","offers":[{"title":"Default Title","offer_id":21626197573711,"sku":"AC-770-232005","price":14.95,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0805\/5707\/products\/1ee853cd-99b8-4fd9-9ffa-49a0140ced8d.jpg?v=1595887620"},{"product_id":"aashiyana-wood-box-blossom-matr-boomie-b","title":"Aashiyana Wood Box - Blossom","description":"\u003cp\u003eSmall wooden box intricately carved and painted with a lovely white finish.
